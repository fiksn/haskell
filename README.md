# Haskell bits

Some people solved [AOC](https://adventofcode.com/2024). Congrats! I find it a bit boring and repetitive however. Besides I don't have that much time every day.
I will however use some of the challenges from AOC or elsewhere (Leetcode perhaps?) to better learn Haskell. Please don't laugh, those samples here are my current proficiency. Haskell obviously isn't my first programming language.
Not even language of choice - until NOW.
